Casey and Mo's Web App Project

We are planning to create a web app that will show the menu items for the dining halls around campus, like Canyon Vista or Pines. Using screen scraping, we will copy the data from http://hdh.ucsd.edu and allow users to rate the meals and to view the previous ratings of said meals.
